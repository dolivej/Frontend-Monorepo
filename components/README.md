## Components Workspace

This workspace contains component libraries. For now we will start with a single component library (built with Typescript, React, and Storybook).

But as we scale and have more products we may need to split this into different modules. For example, Landlord functionality will have more complicated web application components for managing tenants, lease guarantees and buildings (more B2B components).
